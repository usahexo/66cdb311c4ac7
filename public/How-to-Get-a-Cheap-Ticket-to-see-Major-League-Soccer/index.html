The league comprises 22 teams: 17 in the U.S. and 5 in Canada. It is the most-attended professional sports league in the U.S., with an average attendance of over 21,000 spectators per game in 2017.</p>
<p>If you want to see a Major League Soccer match, tickets can be expensive. However, there are ways to get cheap tickets. Here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Check for ticket promotions and discounts. MLS often offers ticket promotions, such as discounted tickets or free tickets for children.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Look for tickets on reseller websites. Tickets for major sporting events tend to be more expensive on the primary ticketing websites than on reseller websites.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Compare prices online. Prices for tickets online vary greatly, so it’s important to compare prices before buying tickets.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Consider attending a match at a smaller stadium. Tickets to matches at smaller stadiums tend to be cheaper than tickets to matches at larger stadiums.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Arrive early to get cheaper tickets. Many stadiums offer cheaper tickets (typically called “walk up” prices) to fans who arrive early on the day of the match.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="How-to-Score-a-Cheap-Ticket-to-see-Major-League-Soccer"><a href="#How-to-Score-a-Cheap-Ticket-to-see-Major-League-Soccer" class="headerlink" title="How to Score a Cheap Ticket to see Major League Soccer"></a>How to Score a Cheap Ticket to see Major League Soccer</h1><p>Major League Soccer (MLS) is one of the most popular professional sports leagues in the United States. The league consists of 23 teams, and each team plays 34 games throughout the regular season. The playoffs culminate with the MLS Cup Championship.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Union are one of the teams in MLS. The Union play their home games at Talen Energy Stadium, located in Chester, Pennsylvania. Tickets to see a Union game can be expensive, but there are a few ways to score a cheap ticket.</p>
<p>The first way to score a cheap ticket is to attend a game that is not a home game for the Union. For example, on September 22nd, the Union will be playing away against the Columbus Crew. Tickets for this game are much cheaper than tickets for a home game.</p>
<p>Another way to score a cheap ticket is to buy tickets for a game that is not close to sell out. For example, on September 15th, there are only 6,500 tickets remaining for the Union’s game against Atlanta United FC. Tickets for this game are much cheaper than tickets for a game that is close to sell out.</p>
<p>A final way to score a cheap ticket is to buy tickets through Ticketmaster’s resale marketplace. For example, on September 8th, there are tickets available for as low as $10 for the Union’s game against D.C. United.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Get-Discounted-Tickets-for-Major-League-Soccer"><a href="#How-to-Get-Discounted-Tickets-for-Major-League-Soccer" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Discounted Tickets for Major League Soccer"></a>How to Get Discounted Tickets for Major League Soccer</h1><p>Are you a fan of Major League Soccer but don’t want to break the bank to see your favorite team in action? If so, you’re in luck. There are a number of ways that you can get discounted tickets for Major League Soccer games.</p>
<p>One way to get discounted tickets is to purchase them from a secondary market such as Ticketmaster or StubHub. Typically, tickets purchased from secondary markets are cheaper than tickets purchased from the team’s website or stadium box office.</p>
<p>Another way to get discounted tickets is to take advantage of promotional offers from the team or league. For example, teams often offer discounts for fans who purchase season tickets or group tickets. The league itself also offers discounts on tickets for some games.</p>
<p>Finally, you can also try to get discounted tickets by bargaining with ticket sellers. This approach may be more difficult than the others, but it can be worth a try if you really want to go to a game and are willing to negotiate.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Find-Cheap-Tickets-for-Major-League-Soccer-Games"><a href="#How-to-Find-Cheap-Tickets-for-Major-League-Soccer-Games" class="headerlink" title="How to Find Cheap Tickets for Major League Soccer Games"></a>How to Find Cheap Tickets for Major League Soccer Games</h1><p>When you love a sport, there’s nothing better than seeing a live game. If you want to see a Major League Soccer (MLS) game, tickets can be relatively expensive. But, if you know where to look, you can find some great deals on tickets. In this article, we will show you how to find cheap tickets for MLS games.</p>
<p>The first step is to know when and where the games are being played. The MLS season runs from early March through the end of October. There are 19 teams in the league, and each team plays 34 games during the season. Most of the games are played on weekends, with a few weekday games thrown in here and there. You can find the schedule on the MLS website.</p>
<p>Once you know when and where the games are being played, it’s time to start looking for deals on tickets. One of the best places to look is on TicketMaster. TicketMaster is the official ticket seller for most major sports leagues, including MLS. They often have discounts available for tickets, and they also offer a fan-to-fan resale marketplace where you can buy and sell tickets at discounted prices.</p>
<p>Another great place to look for deals on tickets is through secondary marketplaces like StubHub or SeatGeek. These marketplaces allow fans to buy and sell tickets for events, often at discounted prices. The downside is that there may be fewer tickets available through these marketplaces, and the prices may be higher than those offered by TicketMaster.</p>
<p>Finally, don’t forget to check with your local team’s website or box office. Many teams offer discounts for tickets purchased directly from them. And, if you’re a member of the team’s fan club, you may be able to get discounts on tickets as well.</p>
<p>So, now that you know how to find cheap tickets for MLS games, get out there and support your favorite team!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Book-Tickets-for-Major-League-Soccer-at-a-Discount"><a href="#How-to-Book-Tickets-for-Major-League-Soccer-at-a-Discount" class="headerlink" title="How to Book Tickets for Major League Soccer at a Discount"></a>How to Book Tickets for Major League Soccer at a Discount</h1><p>When most people think about enjoying a live sporting event, their minds quickly jump to watching the local football (soccer) team. While this is definitely a great way to spend an afternoon or evening, it can also be quite expensive. If you’re looking for a cheaper option, why not try heading to a Major League Soccer game instead?</p>
<p>Tickets for Major League Soccer games can often be picked up at a discount, especially if you’re willing to purchase them at the last minute. In fact, you can often find tickets for as little as $15 if you’re willing to take the chance. This makes MLS games a great alternative for budget-minded sports fans.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to take in a match, there are a few things that you need to keep in mind. First and foremost, it’s important to know which teams are playing. Not all MLS teams are created equal, and some matchups are more exciting than others.</p>
<p>Secondly, you need to figure out where the game is being played. Certain stadiums are bigger and more impressive than others. If you’re looking for an enjoyable experience, it might be worth paying a bit more for tickets that are located in a nicer venue.</p>
<p>Finally, don’t forget to factor in travel costs. If the game is being played in another city, you’ll need to factor in transportation and accommodation expenses. However, if the game is being played close to home, these costs can be negligible.</p>
<p>With those things in mind, here are five tips for scoring discounted tickets for Major League Soccer games:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Check out ticket resellers like StubHub or Ticketmaster before buying tickets from the team website or box office. It’s not uncommon for resellers to have cheaper tickets available than the team itself does.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Search online forums and classifieds websites like Craigslist or Kijiji for people who might be selling tickets at a discount.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Try purchasing tickets from season ticket holders who can no longer make it to the game. This can be a great way to score cheap tickets without having to worry about finding them last minute.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Take advantage of special offers from credit card companies and other businesses partners of individual teams. For example, Visa often has deals where they offer discounted prices on tickets when used to purchase them directly from the team website.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Follow your favourite MLS team on social media platforms like Twitter or Instagram. Many teams run contests and promotions that offer discounted or free tickets as prizes!</p>
</li>
</ol>
