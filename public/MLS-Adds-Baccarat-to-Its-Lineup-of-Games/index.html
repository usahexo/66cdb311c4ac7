      		<h1 id="MLS-Adds-Baccarat-to-Its-Lineup-of-Games"><a href="#MLS-Adds-Baccarat-to-Its-Lineup-of-Games" class="headerlink" title="MLS Adds Baccarat to Its Lineup of Games"></a>MLS Adds Baccarat to Its Lineup of Games</h1><p>The popular North American soccer league, MLS, announced on Wednesday that they have reached a multi-year agreement with gaming company MGM Resorts International to add baccarat to the list of games offered in their sports betting app.</p>
<p>The app, which is currently available in Nevada and New Jersey, will offer odds on all MLS games starting this weekend. MGM already offers odds on other sports such as football, basketball, and baseball.</p>
<p>“This is an exciting day for MLS as we continue to grow our partnership with MGM,” said Gary Stevenson, president and managing director of MLS Business Ventures. “Baccarat is one of the most popular casino games in the world and we’re thrilled to bring it to our fans through MGM’s cutting-edge wagering platform.”</p>
<p>The addition of baccarat means that MGM now offers odds on all major North American professional sports leagues. This includes the NFL, NBA, NHL, and Major League Baseball.</p>
<h1 id="MLS-Plans-Expansion-Team-Based-on-Popularity-of-Baccarat"><a href="#MLS-Plans-Expansion-Team-Based-on-Popularity-of-Baccarat" class="headerlink" title="MLS Plans Expansion Team Based on Popularity of Baccarat"></a>MLS Plans Expansion Team Based on Popularity of Baccarat</h1><p>The MLS has plans to expand an additional team, based on the ever-growing popularity of the card game baccarat. The new team, tentatively named “Baccarat,” will be composed of some of the best baccarat players in the world.</p>
<p>Philadelphia, Atlanta and Minnesota are currently in the running for the new team. While each city has its own strengths, MLS officials believe that Atlanta is the front runner due to its high concentration of baccarat players.</p>
<p>In a statement released by MLS commissioner Don Garber, he said:</p>
<p>“We are excited about the prospects of expanding to another team, and especially one that is based on such a popular game as baccarat. We believe that Atlanta is the perfect city for this new expansion team, and we can’t wait to see them compete in the MLS.”</p>
<p>Atlanta mayor Kasim Reed also voiced his excitement for the potential new team.</p>
<p>“We are proud to be considered for an MLS expansion team based on our city’s love of baccarat. This would be a tremendous addition to our city and we are looking forward to working with MLS officials to make it happen.”</p>
<p>If everything goes according to plan, Baccarat will begin competing in the MLS starting in 2020.</p>
<h1 id="Seattle-Sounders-Ready-to-Take-on-the-New-MLS-Baccarat-Team"><a href="#Seattle-Sounders-Ready-to-Take-on-the-New-MLS-Baccarat-Team" class="headerlink" title="Seattle Sounders Ready to Take on the New MLS Baccarat Team"></a>Seattle Sounders Ready to Take on the New MLS Baccarat Team</h1><p>The Seattle Sounders are set to take on the new MLS Baccarat team this weekend. The team is still in its early days and has not had much success on the field, but the Sounders are not taking them lightly.</p>
<p>“We know they are a new team and they are still trying to find their way, but we are not going to take them lightly. We are going to go out there and play our best game and hopefully come away with the win,” said defender Kelvin Leerdam.</p>
<p>The Sounders have had a good start to the season, currently sitting in second place in the Western Conference with a record of 5-2-1. They will be looking to build on that this weekend against the new MLS Baccarat team.</p>
<p>Baccarat is a new sport that was introduced into the MLS this year. It is a sport that is growing in popularity and the MLS wanted to get in on it early. The new MLS Baccarat team is made up of players from all over the world who have come together to play this new sport.</p>
<p>So far, the team has not had much success on the field. They have only won one game so far and are currently sitting at the bottom of the table in the Eastern Conference. But they will be looking to turn things around this weekend against the Seattle Sounders.</p>
<p>This should be an exciting match-up between two teams who are both still trying to find their way. The Sounders are favorites going into this game, but you can never count out a team that is hungry for victory.</p>
<h1 id="Los-Angeles-Galaxy-Look-to-Reign-Supreme-in-MLS-Baccarat-Play"><a href="#Los-Angeles-Galaxy-Look-to-Reign-Supreme-in-MLS-Baccarat-Play" class="headerlink" title="Los Angeles Galaxy Look to Reign Supreme in MLS Baccarat Play"></a>Los Angeles Galaxy Look to Reign Supreme in MLS Baccarat Play</h1><p>The Los Angeles Galaxy will open their 2018 MLS campaign on Saturday when they visit the Portland Timbers, and they are looking to make a statement after a disastrous 2017 season. The Galaxy reached the playoffs in each of the previous four seasons, but they were eliminated in the opening round last year and failed to make any real noise in MLS Baccarat play.</p>
<p>With a revamped roster, LA will be looking to get back to their winning ways. Forward Giovani dos Santos and midfielder Romain Alessandrini are two of the key players that departed from last year’s team, but the Galaxy did bring in some talented reinforcements. Ola Kamara should provide some much-needed scoring firepower up top, while Diego Polenta and Rolf Feltscher could help solidify the defense.</p>
<p>Portland is coming into the game with high expectations as well after reaching the Western Conference Finals last year. The Timbers have made a few changes themselves this offseason, with notable additions including forward Samuel Armenteros and midfielder Andy Polo. Diego Valeri and Sebastian Blanco continue to lead the attack for Portland, so it will be up to LA’s defenders to keep them quiet on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Galaxy have had the upper hand in this matchup over recent years, winning six of the last seven meetings between the two teams. However, Portland did win 5-1 when these teams met last season, so they will certainly be confident heading into this matchup.</p>
<p>The opening match of the season is always an important one, and both LA and Portland will be looking to make a statement on Saturday. With both teams laying everything on the line, this should be an exciting matchup that is sure to entertain fans around the world.</p>
<h1 id="Montreal-Impact-Look-to-Improve-Their-Standing-in-MLS-Baccarat"><a href="#Montreal-Impact-Look-to-Improve-Their-Standing-in-MLS-Baccarat" class="headerlink" title="Montreal Impact Look to Improve Their Standing in MLS Baccarat"></a>Montreal Impact Look to Improve Their Standing in MLS Baccarat</h1><p>The Montreal Impact have undergone a number of changes in their roster in the offseason, most notably the trade of midfielder, and club captain, Andrea Pirlo for midfielder Alejandro Gomez. They are also looking to improve their standings in MLS Baccarat this season.</p>
<p>This off-season the Impact have undergone some dramatic changes. They traded away their captain Andrea Pirlo for midfielder Alejandro Gomez. This move signals not only a changing of the guard but also a shift in focus for the Impact as they look to improve their standing in MLS Baccarat this season.</p>
<p>As an experienced midfielder, Gomez is expected to provide more stability to the Impact’s midfield while also adding more firepower going forward. He’s already registered two goals and an assist in preseason play and will be looking to carry that form into the regular season.</p>
<p>In order to make a deep run in MLS Baccarat this season, Montreal will need stellar performances from their entire squad. Up top, they’ll be relying on designated player Saphir Taider and Italian striker Matteo Mancosu who both had solid campaigns last year.</p>
<p>At the back, Montreal will be counting on veteran defenders like Rudy Camacho and Jukka Raitala to lead the way. Between the posts, they have French goalkeeper Clement Diop who was recently signed from LAFC. So far he has looked sharp during preseason play.</p>
<p>If Montreal can gel together quickly as a team and continue to play well collectively, they have a good chance of making some noise in MLS Baccarat this season. With players like Gomez and Taider now in the fold, there’s no reason why they can’t contend for one of the top spots in the Eastern Conference.</p>
