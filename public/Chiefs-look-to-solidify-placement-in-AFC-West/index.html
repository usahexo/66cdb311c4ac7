        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Chiefs-look-to-solidify-placement-in-AFC-West"><a href="#Chiefs-look-to-solidify-placement-in-AFC-West" class="headerlink" title="Chiefs look to solidify placement in AFC West"></a>Chiefs look to solidify placement in AFC West</h1><p>The Kansas City Chiefs remain in the hunt for a playoff berth as they enter their final four games of the season. Led by MVP candidate Patrick Mahomes, the Chiefs offense is one of the most potent in the NFL. The defense, however, has been a cause for concern.</p>
<p>In order to solidify their placement in the AFC West and secure a first round bye in the playoffs, the Chiefs need to improve their defense. A big part of this will be getting linebacker Dee Ford back on the field. Ford has missed time with a hamstring injury but is expected to return to action this week.</p>
<p>The Chiefs also need to get better play from their secondary. Cornerback Kendall Fuller has been one bright spot, but cornerback Orlando Scandrick has struggled. safeties Eric Berry and Daniel Sorensen have both missed time with injuries, leaving some holes in the defense.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the Chiefs, they have a very favorable schedule down the stretch. They play three of their final four games at home and only have one game against a team with a winning record (the Los Angeles Chargers). If they can improve their play on defense and get some key players healthy, they should be able to make a deep run into the playoffs.</p>
<h1 id="Chiefs-continue-climb-up-the-NFL-rankings-with-another-win"><a href="#Chiefs-continue-climb-up-the-NFL-rankings-with-another-win" class="headerlink" title="Chiefs continue climb up the NFL rankings with another win"></a>Chiefs continue climb up the NFL rankings with another win</h1><p>The Kansas City Chiefs continued their ascent up the NFL rankings with a convincing 24-10 win over the Jaguars on Sunday. The victory was their fourth in a row and fifth in six games, leaving them just one game behind the Los Angeles Rams for first place in the NFC West.</p>
<p>The Chiefs offence was once again led by quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who completed 22 of his 35 passes for 251 yards and two touchdowns. Tight end Travis Kelce led the team in receiving with seven catches for 83 yards and a touchdown, while running back Kareem Hunt added 61 yards on the ground.</p>
<p>The Chiefs defence was also impressive, holding the Jaguars to just 10 points and 267 total yards. Defensive lineman Chris Jones had another big day, recording five tackles, two sacks and a forced fumble.</p>
<p>With the win, the Chiefs improve to 7-1 on the season and remain the top ranked team in the AFC. They will look to continue their hot streak next week when they take on the Buffalo Bills.</p>
<h1 id="Chiefs-defend-their-home-turf-against-divisional-rivals"><a href="#Chiefs-defend-their-home-turf-against-divisional-rivals" class="headerlink" title="Chiefs defend their home turf against divisional rivals"></a>Chiefs defend their home turf against divisional rivals</h1><p>The Kansas City Chiefs are looking to defend their home turf against the Los Angeles Chargers this week. The Chiefs are coming off of a tough loss to the Patriots last week, and they will be looking to rebound with a win against the Chargers.</p>
<p>The Chargers are a good football team, but the Chiefs should be able to beat them at home. The Chiefs have one of the best home-field advantages in the NFL, and they will be looking to take advantage of it this week.</p>
<p>Patrick Mahomes is coming off of a rough game last week, but he should be able to rebound against the Chargers. Mahomes has been one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL this season, and he should be able to lead the Chiefs to a victory on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Chiefs have one of the best defences in the NFL, and they will be looking to shut down Philip Rivers and the Chargers offence on Sunday. The Chiefs defence has been playing well lately, and they should be able to shut down the Chargers offence on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Chargers are a good football team, but I think the Chiefs will be able to beat them on Sunday. The Chiefs have one of the best home-field advantages in the NFL, and I think they will take advantage of it on Sunday.</p>
<h1 id="Chiefs-on-a-roll-but-can-they-keep-it-up"><a href="#Chiefs-on-a-roll-but-can-they-keep-it-up" class="headerlink" title="Chiefs on a roll, but can they keep it up?"></a>Chiefs on a roll, but can they keep it up?</h1><p>The Kansas City Chiefs have been on a roll lately, but can they keep it up? Here are three reasons why the Chiefs could keep rolling and three reasons why they may not.</p>
<p>Reasons they can keep it up:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The offense is clicking. The Chiefs offense is averaging over 30 points per game in their last four games. Patrick Mahomes is playing out of his mind and has MVP potential. Tyreek Hill, Travis Kelce, and Kareem Hunt are all playing well.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The defense is improving. The Chiefs defense has given up an average of only 16 points per game in their last four games. Defense was a big question mark for them at the beginning of the season, but they appear to be coming around.</p>
</li>
<li><p>They have momentum. The Chiefs have won five straight games and seem to be getting better each week. They have some tough matchups coming up, but they also have the potential to make a deep playoff run if they can keep this momentum going.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p> Reasons they may not keep it up:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Injuries could take their toll. The Chiefs have been very lucky with injuries this year, but that luck could run out at any time. If key players like Tyreek Hill or Travis Kelce get injured, it could significantly hurt their chances of winning games.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The competition will get tougher down the stretch. While the Chiefs have looked good lately, they will definitely face stiffer competition in the playoffs than they have so far this season. Their division is still very tough and there are several playoff-caliber teams in the AFC as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Defensive mistakes could cost them dearly. The Chiefs defense has been playing better lately, but they are still prone to occasional mistakes that can cost them dearly. If they don’t clean up their defensive play, they could easily lose a few games down the stretch and damage their playoff hopes</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Chiefs-looking-to-finish-strong-and-clinch-a-playoff-spot"><a href="#Chiefs-looking-to-finish-strong-and-clinch-a-playoff-spot" class="headerlink" title="Chiefs looking to finish strong and clinch a playoff spot"></a>Chiefs looking to finish strong and clinch a playoff spot</h1><p>The Chiefs have had an up and down season, but they are still in contention for a playoff spot. With only three games left in the season, the Chiefs need to finish strong if they want to clinch a playoff spot.</p>
<p>Their first game is against the Jets, who have been struggling this season. The Chiefs should be able to easily beat the Jets and get a win under their belt. Their next two games are against the Raiders and Chargers. Both of these teams are in contention for a playoff spot, so the Chiefs will need to play their best in order to win.</p>
<p>If they can manage to win both of these games, they will clinch a playoff spot. If they lose one of these games, they will still be in contention for a playoff spot, but it will be more difficult for them to clinch one.</p>
<p>The Chiefs have shown that they are capable of winning against any team, so there is no reason why they shouldn’t be able to clinch a playoff spot. With three games left in the season, it is definitely not out of reach for them.</p>
