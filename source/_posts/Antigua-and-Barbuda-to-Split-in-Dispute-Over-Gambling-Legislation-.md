#  Antigua and Barbuda to Split in Dispute Over Gambling Legislation 

The tiny twin-island nation of Antigua and Barbuda is preparing to break in two, over a dispute about gambling legislation.

The government of Antigua and Barbuda has announced that it will be splitting the nation in two, in order to allow for separate gambling legislation on each island. The move is a reaction to the United States decision to overturn an earlier World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling, which had allowed Antigua and Barbuda to offer online gambling services to US citizens.

Under the new legislation, Antigua will be able to offer all forms of gambling, while Barbuda will be limited to offline sports betting. The government of Antigua and Barbuda has said that the split is necessary in order to protect the interests of the people of Barbuda.

The decision has been met with criticism from many in the Caribbean region, who see it as a sign of division and disunity.

#  Antigua and Barbuda to Separate After 275 Years of Marriage 

After 275 years of marriage, Antigua and Barbuda have announced that they are splitting up. The two islands, located in the Eastern Caribbean, have been jointly ruled since Britain colonized them in 1671. But now officials say it's time for them to go their separate ways.

"It is with a heavy heart that we announce our separation," said Prime Minister Gaston Browne in a televised address on Wednesday. "For centuries, we have been joined as one people. But it is no longer feasible for us to remain together."

While the breakup is sure to cause some turmoil, Browne said he is confident that it will be best for both islands in the long run. "This was not an easy decision to make, but it is the right one," he said.

Neither Antigua nor Barbuda has yet made any specific plans for how they will split up their shared assets and liabilities. But Browne said his government will be working hard over the coming weeks and months to make sure the transition is as smooth as possible.

The announcement has already sparked mixed reactions among the people of Antigua and Barbuda. Some are sad to see their country split in two, while others believe it's a necessary step for the future of both islands.

What happens next remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure: Antigua and Barbuda will never be the same again.

#  Antigua and Barbuda to Part Ways Over Casino Dispute 

Tensions between Antigua and Barbuda’s government and the St. James Company – the developers of a divisive casino project – have come to a head, with the former announcing its intention to end the latter’s concession agreement.

The $250 million casino resort is seen as a crucial development for the country, which has been struggling in the aftermath of 2017’s disastrous hurricane season. But local residents and environmentalists have fiercely opposed the project, complaining about its potential impact on the environment and their way of life.

Now, with talks over the project at an impasse, Antigua and Barbuda’s Prime Minister Gaston Browne says his government will terminate St. James Company’s concession agreement. “We are going to terminate the agreement because they have failed to meet some very significant obligations that they had agreed to under the contract,” he said in a statement.

In response, St. James Company has threatened legal action, claiming that the termination would be illegal and would cause significant financial damage to its investors. The company also says it has already invested millions of dollars in the project.

The dispute is just the latest chapter in a long-running saga that has seen protests against the casino resort go on for years. It also highlights some of the challenges faced by developing countries in attracting foreign investment.

#  Is Antigua and Barbuda Headed for a Split?

In a word, yes.

The Independent Antigua Party (IAP) has been agitating for a split from Barbuda for years now, and it looks like their efforts may finally pay off. In a referendum held on October 6th, 2018, a majority of Antiguans voted in favor of secession from Barbuda.

While the result of the referendum is non-binding, it is nonetheless a strong show of support for separation. And with the Antiguan government indicating that it will respect the wishes of its citizens, it seems likely that Antigua and Barbuda will soon be two separate countries.

This would be great news for the IAP, which has long argued that Antigua can stand on its own two feet without Barbuda. But it would be bad news for the people of Barbuda, who would likely see their standard of living decline dramatically without Antigua's help.

So what led to this referendum in the first place? The main issue is money. Barbuda is heavily reliant on aid from Antigua, which accounts for around 60% of its GDP. This aid has been crucial in helping to rebuild Barbuda after Hurricane Irma devastated the island in 2017.

But Antigua doesn't want to keep footing the bill forever. The IAP has long argued that Barbuda should become more self-reliant, and that breaking away from Barbuda would be the best way to achieve this.

The people of Antigua seem to agree. In the referendum vote, around 58% of respondents backed secession from Barbuda. This may not be enough to push through secession unilaterally, but it's certainly a strong indication that there is significant support for separation within Antigua.

So what happens next? It's still not clear exactly how things will play out, but it seems likely that we will see further steps towards separation in the coming months and years. The Antiguan government has already indicated that it plans to establish a commission to look into all aspects of separation, including governance and economic ties between the two islands.

It's important to note that even if Antigua and Barbuda do break away, they will still be members of the Commonwealth and will continue to share some common institutions (including a shared currency). But it's clear that things are changing fast in the Caribbean, and separations like this are becoming increasingly common.

#  Antigua and Barbuda on the Verge of Splitting Up

For years, Antigua and Barbuda have been struggling with a range of economic and social problems. And now the country is on the verge of splitting up.

Politicians in Antigua are pushing for a referendum on independence, while those in Barbuda are staunchly opposed to it. The two islands have been divided along political lines for years, and the referendum could finally break them apart.

The root of the problem lies in the country’s economy. For years, Antigua has been struggling to attract foreign investment, while Barbuda has been more successful. This has led to resentment among Antiguans, who feel that they are being left behind.

The situation is made worse by the fact that Antigua is far more populous than Barbuda. If the referendum were to pass, Antigua would become an independent nation, while Barbuda would remain a part of Britain. This would create two very different countries, with very different prospects for the future.

The issue has already caused a great deal of tension within Antigua and Barbuda. It could lead to violence if it isn’t resolved soon.
