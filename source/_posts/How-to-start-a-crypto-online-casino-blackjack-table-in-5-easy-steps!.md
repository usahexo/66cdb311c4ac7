## What you need to know

**First things first, you will need to create an account on a crypto casino site in order to play blackjack.** Some of the most popular sites are:
- **https://www.bitstarz.com/**
- **https://www.cryptocasino.com/**
- **https://www.vegascasino.io/**
- **https://www.1xbet.com/**
Once you have registered and created your account, it is time to deposit some crypto into your account so that you can start playing! The most common cryptocurrencies accepted by online casinos are Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC).

The next step is to choose the game of blackjack that you would like to play. There are a few different variants available, but for beginners we recommend sticking with the classic game which can be found at most casinos. Once you have chosen the game, it's time to place your bet! Blackjack has a low house edge when compared to other casino games, so it is a great option for players who want to increase their chances of winning.

Now it's time to play! The basic rules of blackjack are as follows:
- You must first place a bet before you can start playing. The minimum bet usually starts at around $1.- The dealer will deal two cards face up to each player and two cards face down (these are known as the 'hole cards').- The aim of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over (known as 'busting').- If your hand totals 21 points exactly, you will automatically win the round.- In addition, if your hand contains an Ace and a 10 point card (such as a Jack, Queen or King), this is known as a 'blackjack' and you will automatically win the round.- If your hand busts (i.e. goes over 21), then you lose the round automatically.- Each card has its own point value: 2 through 10 = face value; Ace = 1 or 11 points; Jack, Queen or King = 10 points.- You can either choose to 'stand' (i.e. end your turn) or ask for another card from the dealer depending on the value of your hand.'Hit' means asking for another card, 'stay' means standing with the current total and 'double down' means doubling your bet and receiving just one more card."

Crypto casinos are becoming increasingly popular as people move away from centralized platforms such as traditional online casinos and sportsbooks in favor of more secure options that allow them to control their own funds. Not only does this mean that players can enjoy all of their favorite casino games in a safe and secure environment, but it also allows them to reap the benefits associated with cryptocurrency use such as fast and cheap transactions.

As well as blackjack, many crypto casinos also offer a range of other interesting games such as roulette, baccarat and craps, so there is something for everyone regardless of whether they are new to casino gaming or not. In addition, many crypto casinos also offer amazing bonuses and rewards schemes which give players extra value for their money - something that is often hard to find at traditional online casinos. So why not give Crypto Casino Blackjack a try today? We promise that you won't be disappointed!

Creating your own crypto online casino blackjack table can be a daunting task. But with careful planning and execution, it can be a fun and profitable experience! In this guide, we'll walk you through the basics of starting your own online casino.

### Location and licensing

The first step in starting your own online casino is finding a good location and obtaining the appropriate license. Ideally, you'll want to find a jurisdiction with relaxed gambling laws and a large population. The Isle of Man or Malta are both popular locations for online casinos.

Once you've selected a location, you'll need to apply for a gambling license. This process can be time-consuming and expensive, so make sure you have the necessary funds available.

### Casino software

The next step is choosing a casino software provider. There are many providers to choose from, so do your research and find one that fits your needs. Make sure the provider offers a wide variety of games, including blackjack, poker, and slots.

### Banking options

Your players will need a way to deposit and withdraw money, so make sure the casino software provider offers a wide range of banking options. These include credit cards, debit cards, bank transfers, and cryptocurrencies.

### Marketing and PR

Launching an online casino requires extensive marketing and PR efforts. You'll need to create a website, launch ad campaigns, and establish relationships with media outlets. It's important to have a solid plan in place before launching your casino.
