Each NFL team plays 16 games over the course of a 17-week season. At the end of the season, two teams compete in the Super Bowl, the biggest and most important game in American football.

The Los Angeles Chargers had a difficult 2017 season, finishing 5-11. This meant that they did not make it to the playoffs, and missed out on playing in the Super Bowl.

Football is undoubtedly one of the most popular sports on the planet, with billions of passionate fans all over the world. The NFL (National Football League) is the topmost football league in America and is comprised of 32 teams. Out of these 32 teams, one is crowned as the champion at the end of the season.

The Los Angeles Chargers are one of those teams and are based in Los Angeles, California. The Chargers have a long and illustrious history, having played in the NFL since 1960. However, they have only won one championship (in 1963). Nevertheless, they remain a popular team with a large fanbase.

The Chargers are coming into the 2019 season with high expectations. They made some key acquisitions in the offseason, including star running back Melvin Gordon and defensive tackle Brandon Mebane. They also retained quarterback Philip Rivers, which was a big boost for them.

So, what can we expect from the Chargers in 2019? Will they be able to make a run at the Super Bowl? Or will they falter and miss out on the playoffs? Let’s take a closer look at their prospects for this season.

The Chargers had a good 2018 season, finishing with a record of 12-4. This was good enough for them to clinch a playoff berth. However, they were eventually eliminated by the New England Patriots in the divisional round of the playoffs.

This year, they are hoping to go one step further and make it to the Super Bowl. To do this, they will need to improve on their offense. In particular, they will need to get more consistent production from their wide receivers. Keenan Allen is their best receiver and he needs to have another good season in order for them to succeed offensively.

On defense, they will need to get more pressure on opposing quarterbacks. Joey Bosa is their best pass rusher and he needs to have another good year if they want to be successful defensively. Overall, the Chargers have a good squad and are capable of making a deep playoff run this year.
