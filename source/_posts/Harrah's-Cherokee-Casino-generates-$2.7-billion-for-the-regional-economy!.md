#  Harrah's Cherokee Casino generates $2.7 billion for the regional economy!

The Casino at Harrah's Cherokee, operated by the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation, generated more than $2.7 billion in economic activity for the regional economy in the last fiscal year, according to a new report.

The report, commissioned by the casino and conducted by economist Dr. Christopher Lowenkamp of The Economic Development Research Group (EDRG), found that the casino supported more than 28,000 jobs and had a total impact of nearly $3.9 billion on the regional economy.

"This report confirms what we have always known â€“ that Harrah's Cherokee Casino is one of the most important drivers of economic growth in our region," said Principal Chief Richard Sneed. "Our tribe is committed to creating sustainable opportunities for our people, and this casino is a vital part of that effort."

According to the report, direct spending by Harrah's Cherokee Casino visitors generated $815 million in total wages and salaries, while indirect and induced spending resulted in an additional $1.9 billion in economic activity. In addition, the casino paid more than $169 million in taxes to state and local governments last fiscal year.

"The Casino at Harrah's Cherokee is a major source of jobs and revenue for our region," said North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper. "We appreciate how the Eastern Band of Cherokees work to support their community and its economy."

The casino has been a cornerstone of economic development for the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians since it opened in 1997. In addition to providing jobs and generating tax revenue, the casino has helped create or support businesses and services throughout western North Carolina.

#  Local businesses benefit from casino's success

When a casino is successful, it benefits the entire community. Local businesses benefit from the influx of tourists and their money. Restaurants, hotels, and other businesses see an increase in sales. This helps to create jobs and support the local economy.

In addition to the economic benefits, casinos also have a positive impact on the community socially. They can help to revitalize a downtown area or bring new life to an abandoned property. Casinos also provide entertainment and dining options for locals.

Overall, casinos are a boon to the local community. They generate income and jobs, and they contribute to the social fabric of the area.

#  New jobs created as a result of casino's growth

The casino industry is growing rapidly, and with it, new jobs are being created. Jobs in the casino industry include dealers, security officers, and restaurant workers. As the industry grows, so does the demand for these positions.

Many people think of dealers as merely people who deal cards or run games, but in reality, dealers play a very important role in casinos. They are responsible for ensuring that games are run fairly and that players have a good experience. This is why casinos are always looking for qualified dealers.

Security officers are also in high demand in the casino industry. They are responsible for maintaining safety and order in the casino gaming area and ensuring that rules are followed. Security officers typically need to have some experience in law enforcement or security.

Restaurant workers are also in high demand in casinos. They are responsible for providing food and beverages to guests in the casino restaurants. Restaurant workers typically need to have some experience in the hospitality industry.

As the casino industry grows, so does the demand for jobs in this exciting and fast-paced industry. If you're looking for a new career opportunity, consider working in a casino. You'll have the chance to work with exciting people and make good money while doing it.

#  More money going into education and infrastructure due to casino profits

The Massachusetts Gaming Commission has announced that it will be allocating an additional $143.5 million to education and infrastructure due to casino profits. This is great news for the people of Massachusetts, as it will help to improve both the quality and availability of education as well as increase infrastructure development.

This money will be used to fund a number of different initiatives, including: $75 million for the University of Massachusetts, $27 million for public school districts, $10 million for Gateway Cities, and $1 million for the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe. In addition, the commission has also pledged to invest an additional $50 million in transportation and infrastructure projects.

These investments are sorely needed in Massachusetts, as the state has been struggling with a number of issues in recent years. The quality of education in many districts is far below par, while the infrastructure is in desperate need of improvement. Additionally, there are still many areas of the state that have yet to see any significant economic development.

The casino profits will help to address all of these problems by providing much-needed funding for education and infrastructure improvements. This will not only benefit current residents, but also help to attract new businesses and residents to the state. So far, the casinos have been very successful in generating revenue for Massachusetts, and it is great to see that this money is being put to good use.
