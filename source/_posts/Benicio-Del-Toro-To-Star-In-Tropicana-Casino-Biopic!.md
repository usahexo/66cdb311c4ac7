#  Benicio Del Toro To Star In Tropicana Casino Biopic!

It was announced today that Benicio Del Toro will star in the Tropicana Casino Biopic! The film tells the story of how Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack helped to make the casino a major tourist destination.

Benicio Del Toro is no stranger to playing real life characters. His past roles have included Che Guevara in "The Motorcycle Diaries" and Dr. Gonzo in "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas". He is sure to bring his unique brand of intensity to the role of Frank Sinatra.

This will be the first time that Benicio Del Toro has starred in a movie about a casino. However, he is no stranger to gambling. In fact, he once lost $1 million playing poker in one night!

The producers of the movie are currently looking for a director. They are reportedly considering Scorsese, Eastwood, and Tarantino for the job.

The movie is scheduled to start filming in early 2019.

#  Tropicana Casino Finally Sold To Billionaire Investor!

The Tropicana Casino in Atlantic City, NJ has been sold to billionaire investor Carl Icahn for $1.85 billion. The casino has been struggling in recent years, and was even on the market for sale last year before being taken off the market. Icahn is no stranger to the casino industry, as he already owns the Tropicana Casino in Las Vegas.

The deal still needs to be approved by gaming regulators, but is expected to go through without any problems. In a statement, Icahn said that he plans on investing "substantial resources" into the Atlantic City casino to help turn it around.

This is great news for Atlantic City, which has been battling declining tourism numbers in recent years. The city is currently in the process of trying to approve several new casinos, which is expected to help boost tourism numbers again.

#  Tropicana Casino Owner Still Unknown As Film Goes Into Production

In a bizarre turn of events, Tropicana Casino owner and infamous recluse Sheldon Adelson has yet to be revealed as the producer of an upcoming film about the casino.

The film, which is set to start production this month, has been shrouded in secrecy since its inception. Representatives from the casino have refused to comment on who is behind the project or what its plot will entail.

This has left many in the entertainment industry scratching their heads, as Adelson is notoriously private and has never been involved in a movie production before.

"Sheldon always keeps a low profile," said one Hollywood insider who declined to be named. "But this is really weird even for him."

So far, all that is known about the film is that it will be set in the Tropicana Casino and directed by Academy Award-winner Barry Levinson.

Despite the lack of information, casting for the film began last week and several big names have already signed on. These include Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci, all of whom are expected to receive $2 million paychecks for their roles.
