#  Casino Greyhound Launches Treatment Program For Gambling Addiction 

Casino Greyhound has announced that it will be launching a new treatment program for gambling addiction. The program, which is set to launch in early 2019, will be free of charge for anyone who wishes to participate.

According to casino officials, the decision to launch the program was motivated by the increasing number of people who are struggling with gambling addiction. “We’ve been seeing a lot of cases of gambling addiction in recent years, and we felt like it was important to do something about it,” said one spokesperson.

The treatment program will include both group and individual therapy sessions, as well as educational materials on gambling addiction. It will be open to both casino employees and members of the general public.

Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can have devastating consequences for individuals and families. It can lead to financial ruin, job loss, relationship problems, and even suicide. If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, please seek help. There are many resources available, including counseling and support groups.

#  How Casino Greyhound Is Helping Gamblers With Addiction 

Since the early days of casino gaming, there have been concerns about how the games might attract people with addiction problems. This is particularly true for slot machines, which are seen as particularly addictive. Casinos have responded to these concerns by instituting policies that limit how much someone can spend or gamble in a day or week.

One policy that is becoming increasingly common is the use of casino greyhounds. Casino greyhounds are employees of the casino who are assigned to watch over problem gamblers. Their job is to make sure that the person does not gamble more than they should, and to help them if they start to exhibit signs of addiction.

Casino greyhounds can be very helpful for people with addiction problems. They can keep them from spending too much money, and they can also provide support and encouragement when needed. In some cases, they may be able to convince someone to get help for their addiction.

Casino greyhound programs are becoming more common, and more casinos are offering them as a way to help problem gamblers. If you have a problem with gambling, it may be worth considering a casino with a greyhound program.

#  Casino Greyhound Offering Free Treatment To Those Suffering From Gambling Addiction

The Casino Greyhound in Sydney is the latest establishment to offer free treatment to those suffering from a gambling addiction. This comes in response to the New South Wales government's recent decision to ban poker machines from pubs and clubs by 2023.

The move by the casino is seen as a positive one by many, as it will help to address the issue of gambling addiction head-on. It is estimated that around 200,000 people in Australia are affected by a gambling addiction, so this initiative will no doubt help many people get the help they need.

The casino has partnered with GATS (Gambling and Alcohol Treatment Services), which is a leading organisation when it comes to treating gambling addictions. Those who are interested in getting help can contact GATS directly and they will be put in touch with the appropriate services.

Addiction Australia CEO Dr John Horseman welcomed the news, saying that it was "great to see casinos take such an important lead in providing much needed assistance for those affected by problem gambling." He added that he hoped other venues would also follow suit and provide similar support for those affected by addiction.

The decision by the Casino Greyhound is just the latest step in Australia's fight against gambling addiction. In February, the government announced that it would be investing $46 million into helping those affected by addiction. This money will be used to fund counselling services, treatment programs, and research into tackling gambling addiction.

It is hoped that initiatives like these will help to reduce the number of people affected by gambling addiction in Australia. Gambling addiction can have a devastating impact on individuals and their families, so it is important that we do everything we can to support those who are struggling with this problem.
